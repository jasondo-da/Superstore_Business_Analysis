## Project Introduction

The Superstore business is experiencing a significant financial downturn and must consider bankruptcy. I have been hired as a consultant to review the Superstore's logistics and operations to increase its profitability and avoid bankruptcy. The objective is to save the Superstore from bankruptcy by optimizing the business and increasing profitability. The key focus areas include product analysis, cash flow analysis, and discovering alternative methods to increase revenue and cash flow.

## Analysis Outline

Part 1: Profits & Losses

- Generated a heatmap to measure store performance within each state

- Identified state and city profit/loss leaders

- Identified product categories that generate the most profit for the Superstore  

- Identified product categories that generate the most losses for the Superstore  

- Made suggestions on which sub-categories Superstore should stop selling

Part 2: Return Rate

- Discovered the products that have the highest return rate

- Located in multiple cities with high returns that are directly causing losses to Superstore

- Listed multiple customers/businesses that habitually return the most frequently

- Identified the most returned products by category

Part 3: Advertising

- Located multiple opportunities for revenue growth in three US locations by increasing ad spending 

- Identified the categories that generates the most profit for Superstore that could be used for ads

## Executive Summary

### Conclusion

In conclusion, there are many areas for optimization for the Superstore to improve on. One area is to reduce returns from specific customers/businesses specifically in Texas, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. These stores should be audited for any issues with the product supply chain and customer service since these stores are operating at a significant loss compared to the stores in neighboring states. If they are not fixable Superstore should consider closing these stores down to cut their losses and spend their capital on more productive investments before considering bankruptcy. Another area for improvement is to audit our suppliers, delivery services, storage services, and product description for the furniture products, specifically tables and bookcases. If the product issue is not easily fixable then Superstore should consider discontinuing these two sub-categories of products since they are the significant top two net loss leaders. Lastly, Superstore should increase ad spend in Indiana, Minnesota, and Vermont if they are looking for a safe ROMI since those states are already doing well without ad spending.

### Key Findings

Cashflow Suggestions:

- Audit store operations from Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and North Carolina since these states have the highest profit losses to see if store issues are fixable

- Inquire into stores from San Antonio, Philadelphia, and Houston first on why their return rates are significantly higher than average and why they are underperforming at a large loss

- Inquire into stores from cities like New York City and Seattle to see why those stores are outperforming and see if their operation method is replicable to other stores

- Close stores that are operating at a significant loss in struggling regions

- Increase ad spend in Indiana, Minnesota, and Vermont in the fall season for the safest ROMI since many students are going back to school and will be in need of school supplies

Returns Suggestions:

- Tables and bookcases should be considered to be discontinued since they are heavy net loss leaders if they are not fixable

- Customers with 50+ returns should be asked a survey on their customer experience to see what their issues are with the products they are frequently returning
